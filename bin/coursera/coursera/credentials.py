    For Windows platforms, there are several paths that can be tried to
    retrieve the netrc file. There is, however, no "standard way" of doing
    things.

    A brief recap of the situation (all file paths are written in Unix
    convention):

    1. By default, Windows does not define a $HOME path. However, some
    people might define one manually, and many command-line tools imported
    from Unix will search the $HOME environment variable first. This
    includes MSYSGit tools (bash, ssh, ...) and Emacs.

    2. Windows defines two 'user paths': $USERPROFILE, and the
    concatenation of the two variables $HOMEDRIVE and $HOMEPATH. Both of
    these paths point by default to the same location, e.g.
    C:\\Users\\Username

    3. $USERPROFILE cannot be changed, however $HOMEDRIVE and $HOMEPATH
    can be changed. They are originally intended to be the equivalent of
    the $HOME path, but there are many known issues with them

    4. As for the name of the file itself, most of the tools ported from
    Unix will use the standard '.dotfile' scheme, but some of these will
    instead use "_dotfile". Of the latter, the two notable exceptions are
    vim, which will first try '_vimrc' before '.vimrc' (but it will try
    both) and git, which will require the user to name its netrc file
    '_netrc'.

    Because the whole thing is a mess, I suggest we tried various sensible
    defaults until we succeed or have depleted all possibilities.
